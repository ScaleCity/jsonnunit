## Built with oclif CLI

[oclif](https://oclif.io/) is a framework for building CLIs in Node. It can be used like a simple
flag parser but is capable of much more. It's designed to be extensible so that
you can easily add plugins such as the update warning plugin or build your own
for users to install at runtime. JSONNUNIT uses oclif as a single-command CLI.

## Sjsonnet Support

Sjsonnet is a JVM implementation of the Jsonnet configuration language which speeds up the process of rendering large jsonnet structures.

Due to pervasive caching, sjsonnet is much faster than google/jsonnet. See this
blog post for more details:
[Writing a Faster Jsonnet Compiler](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/10/12/writing-a-faster-jsonnet-compiler.html)

If you have sjsonnunit installed on your local environment, JSONNUNIT will automatically use Sjsonnet instead of JSONNET.

## Based on Mocha

We didn't re-invent the wheel but found inspiration in one of the best tools
currently available for unit testing NodeJS apps. [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the
browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially,
allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions
to the correct test cases.

## Based on Chai

A lot of functionality of JSONNUNIT is inspired by
[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node
and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing
framework.

## Auto-updating 

JSONNUNIT is using the
[oclif update plugin](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-warn-if-update-available)
that will warn you when your version of JSONNUNIT is out-dated. This makes sure
that you don't miss out on new features as soon as they are developed.
